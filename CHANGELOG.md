# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fix script listed in readme instructions
- Handle symlinks properly in file enumeration [#41](https://github.com/fastly/compute-js-static-publish/issues/41)

## [7.0.1] - 2025-04-24

### Fixed

- Add `@latest` to examples of calling the app in scaffolding mode.

## [7.0.0] - 2025-04-24

> [!NOTE]
> Breaking release. Every project will need a re-scaffold.

### Added

- Named Collections
   - Support for named collections of assets that are managed together and can be individually previewed.
   - Expiration trio: --expires-in, --expires-at, --expires-never.
   - Collection selector utilities that can be run at the edge code to activate a collection.
   - Default collection never expires.

- git-style subcommands
   - Actions separated into subcommands, such as `clean`, `publish-content`, and `collections`.
   - Dry-run mode (--dry-run) for commands that mutates KV or disk.

- KV Store
   - Bytes of assets are stored in the Fastly KV Store.
   - Items in the KV Store are keyed by the hash of the file, keeping storage efficient and deduplicated, even across collections.
   - Metadata (file sizes, encodings, compression) for static assets is stored in KV Store Item metadata.
   - Large-object chunking: files > 20 MB are split into segments behind the scenes and reassembled at read time.
   - Upload process has been optimized - files are uploaded in parallel, and are only compressed and uploaded when necessary.
   - Automatic retry with exponential back-off when the Fastly KV API rate-limits a burst of uploads.
   - Fully supported in the local development environment during development.
   - `--local` flag for all management commands. Passing this flag makes the command operate on the local KV Store instead of the Fastly KV Store.

### Changed

- Separate config files:
   - `static-publisher.rc.js` now owns behavior that is common to the scaffolded Compute app
   - publish-time settings are in `publish-content.config.js`.

- Script names in the scaffold are now grouped by environment: `dev:publish`, `dev:start`, `fastly:publish`, `fastly:deploy`.

- Asset inclusion test renamed to `kvStoreAssetInclusionTest` and now expects a boolean return value.

### Removed / Deprecated
 
- This tool drops `wasm-inline`, and no longer inlines bytes of assets into the Wasm binary. 

- Static files metadata is no longer stored in the Wasm binary, 

- This tool drops `moduleAssets`.

## [5.1.1] - 2023-07-06

## [4.2.1] - 2023-05-06

### Fixed

- Fix parsing of contentTypes[] in static-publish.rc.js

## [4.2.0] - 2023-04-26

### Fixed

- Avoid a crash when the project doesn't have devDependencies in package.json.

## [4.1.0] - 2023-04-05

### Added

- Added 'bytes' and 'string' content asset types usable during testing.
- AssetManager: added `getAssetKeys` method
- ContentAsset: added `isLocal` property

### Changed

- Modified metadata to use string identifiers such as 'wasm-inline' and 'object-store'
  instead of a single "isInline" boolean value. This allows other stores to be used during
  tests.
- Compute-Js Content Assets ('wasm-inline' and 'object-store') are only included when
  `@fastly/compute-js-static-publish/build/compute-js` is imported.

### Fixed

- Fixed type of imported metadata file in clean-object-store program.

## [4.0.0] - 2023-03-23

### Added

- Cleaner separation between Content Assets and Module Assets: applications can define which files
  generate which type of asset.
- Object Store mode: Content Assets can selectively be uploaded to and served from the Object Store, allowing the Wasm binary to be much smaller.
- Defined `StoreEntry`, a common interface that can be used to stream data from content assets, regardless of whether that
  data exists inlined into the Wasm artifact or uploaded to Object Store.
- Added support for Brotli and Gzip compression. These assets are pre-compressed at publish time and uploaded alongside
  their raw counterparts, rather than using runtime compression. This feature is enabled automatically if Object Store mode
  is used, and can be selectively enabled otherwise.
- Added support for returning `304 Not Modified` status based on `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` request headers.
- A `PublisherServer` class that maps incoming requests to asset paths.
- Content and metadata available to your application.
- Load JavaScript module assets as code into your Compute JavaScript application.
- `clean-object-store` mode can be used to remove no-longer-used entries from the Object Store.
- Moved [Migration Guide](./MIGRATING.md) into its own separate file with even more information.
- Exported `getObjectStoreKeysFromMetadata()` metadata handling utility from main package. 
- Exported `getDefaultContentTypes()` and other content type utilities from main package. 
- Added preset for Vue (https://vuejs.org/).
- Added preset for Astro (https://astro.build/).

### Changed

- Webpack is no longer required as a dependency, and is disabled by default. If you wish to use Webpack, you can enable
  it through the `--webpack` command line option during project scaffolding.
- No longer uses Expressly to route requests. `index.js` has been simplified using the `PublisherServer` class instead.
- Separated `--root-dir` and `--public-dir`. The public directory is now a `PublisherServer` configuration that represents
  the subset of the published files that map to the web root. This effectively adds the ability to include files in the
  publishing that aren't accessible from the web (at least through `PublisherServer`).
- `static-publish.rc.js` cleaned up:
  - Items related to including/excluding files reorganized;
  - `PublisherServer`-specific settings moved to `server` key.
- Moved default content types into the main package.
- Updated to TypeScript 5 

## [3.6.0] - 2023-02-28

### Added

- Made testing against default content types easier
- Exported types for default-content-types.cjs

  It's now possible to do something like this: 
  ```typescript
  import { defaultContentTypes, testFileContentType } from "@fastly/compute-js-static-publish/resources/default-content-types";
  const testResult = testFileContentType(defaultContentTypes, '/path/to/file.json');
  testResult.binary // false 
  testResult.type // application/json 
  ```

## [3.5.0] - 2023-02-24

### Fixed

- Update generated package.json and fastly.toml to recommended setup
- Updated documentation on migration

## [3.4.0] - 2023-02-16

### Fixed

- SPA and 404 files were being left out
- Corrected typing of loadModule function

## [3.3.0] - 2023-02-16

### Added

- Make assets map available on the StaticAssets object.
- In addition to exporting module assets as [static `import` statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import),
    they can alternatively be exported as [`import()` calls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import).
    At the current time, this feature requires a bundler that supports the `import()` function, such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org). 

## [3.2.1] - 2023-01-30

### Added

- Export additional TypeScript types: AssetBase, StringAsset, and Binary Asset

## [3.2.0] - 2023-01-13

### Fixed

- Added `type` field that had been missing from asset entry
- Content for binary files is now typed as `Uint8Array` rather than `ArrayBuffer`

## [3.1.0] - 2023-01-11

### Added

- Generate statics.d.ts alongside static.js helpful for TypeScript
- Export Config type to describe shape of static-publish.rc.js
- Generated static files have descriptive notice

## [3.0.1] - 2022-12-23

### Fixed

- Updated generated app to @fastly/compute-js-static-publish@3.0.1

## [3.0.0] - 2022-12-23

### Changed

- Updated to @fastly/js-compute@1.0.1
- Updated generated app to @fastly/js-compute@1.0.1
- Updated generated app to @fastly/express@1.0.0-beta.2
- Improve mechanism of serving static files by copying them into the static content dir and using `includeBytes()`, rather than using asset modules

### Fixed

- Enable minimize in `webpack.config.js`

## [2.4.2] - 2022-12-21

### Changed

- auto-index now also applies to request paths that do not have a trailing slash 

## [2.4.1] - 2022-12-02

### Fixed

- Added missing devDependency to `@fastly/compute-js-static-publish`

## [2.4.0] - 2022-12-02

### Changed

- Updated to js-compute@0.5.12
- Updated generated app to js-compute@0.5.12
- Updated generated app's webpack and webpack-cli versions
- Use atob() and removed dependency on Buffer
